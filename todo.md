# TODO

- Add culling back in

    * For generating models only

    * Cull by detecting faces of neighboring tiles that have points matching up with all of the current face's points

- Update documentation

- Giving entities some viewing mode that allows them to be visible from within tiles  

- Use instancing when rendering entities

- Shape icons zoom out for bigger shapes

- Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.

- Refactor UI code or replace with ImGUI

- Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
