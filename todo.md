# TODO

- Fix sprite alpha stuff (implement custom billboard code)

- Fix texture mixup when previewing new map file

    * Happens when texture is selected from the picker, but no tile with that texture is placed on the map

- Update documentation (integrate into the editor?)

## Future updates

- Add image preview in the file picker

- Use instancing when rendering entity spheres

- Make shape icons zoom out to see larger shapes

- Allow secondary textures on tiles
