# TODO

- Update documentation

- Giving entities some viewing mode that allows them to be visible from within tiles

- Use instancing when rendering entities

- Shape icons zoom out for bigger shapes

- Optimize exported geometry by removing redundant faces. 

    * Mark shapes with .obj groups describing which faces to cull (use materials instead of vertex groups)

- Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.

- Refactor UI code or replace with ImGUI

- Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
