# TODO

- Add pagination for texture picker so that everything doesn't need to be loaded at once- 

- Fix bug with the placeholder texture/model being included in the .te3 file

  * Should maybe give the map its own independent texture path list instead of using the global Assets

- Add .ti importer

- Optimize exported geometry by removing redundant faces.

- Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.

- Consistent UV mapping for rotated tiles (or automatic texture mapping)

# FUTURE PLANS

- Consider replacing RayGUI with ImGUI

- Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
