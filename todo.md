# TODO

[ ] Add .ti importer or get rid of the option

[ ] Fix bug with the placeholder texture/model being included in the .te3 file

  * Should maybe give the map its own independent texture path list instead of using the global Assets

[ ] Optimize exported geometry by removing redundant faces.

[ ] Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.

[ ] Consistent UV mapping for rotated tiles (or automatic texture mapping)

# FUTURE PLANS

[ ] Consider replacing RayGUI with ImGUI

[ ] Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
