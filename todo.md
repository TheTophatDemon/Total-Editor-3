# TODO

- Allow entities to be marked as "tile entities" that take control of the tile they are inside of

    * Will prevent the tile from being culled when exporting, and will assign its geometry to its own node

- Update documentation

- Use instancing when rendering entities

## Future updates

- Allow secondary textures on tiles

- Shape icons zoom out for bigger shapes

- Refactor UI code or replace with ImGUI

- Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
