# TODO

- Fix gltf export issue

    * It probably needs to include the indices of the model

- Optimize all shapes for cullability

- Fix issue of culling with transparent textures

- Update documentation

- Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.

    * Can maybe use cgltf, which is already linked through Raylib

- Use instancing when rendering entities

- Giving entities some viewing mode that allows them to be visible from within tiles  

- Shape icons zoom out for bigger shapes

- Refactor UI code or replace with ImGUI

- Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
