# TODO

- Add pagination / parallelism for the picker so that everything doesn't need to be loaded at once

- Add settings for default texture & shape selection

- Add setting for grid scale?

- Add .ti importer

- Optimize exported geometry by removing redundant faces. 

- Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.

# FUTURE PLANS

- Consider replacing RayGUI with ImGUI

- Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
